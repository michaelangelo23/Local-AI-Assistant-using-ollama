LocalAI Assistant is a powerful, privacy-focused AI project that enables you to interact with your documents using the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in offline scenarios. 100% private, ensuring your data never leaves your local environment.

The project provides a robust CLI interface offering all the primitives needed to build private, context-aware AI applications. It leverages the Llama 3 model via Ollama and supports both normal and streaming responses.

## 🎥 Overview

### Key Features

- 🏠 **Local Execution**: Runs entirely on your machine for enhanced privacy
- 💬 **Interactive CLI**: Seamless communication through a command-line interface
- 📁 **File Inspection Mode**: Analyze and query your personal documents
- 🔍 **Multi-format Support**: Works with TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD, PY, JS, HTML, CSS files
- 🧠 **Llama 3 Integration**: Utilizes the advanced Llama 3 model via Ollama
- ⚡ **Concurrent Processing**: Improved performance through parallel file processing
- 🔄 **Real-time Responses**: Stream AI responses as they're generated

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Python 3.7+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)

## 🧩 Architecture

LocalAI Assistant is designed with modularity in mind:

- **CLI Interface**: Manages user input and command processing
- **Ollama Integration**: Interfaces with the Llama 3 model
- **File Processor**: Handles document ingestion and analysis
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves information from processed documents
- **Response Generator**: Produces AI responses based on user input and available knowledge

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
- [ ] Expand support for additional file formats
- [ ] Integrate more language models
- [ ] Enhance context management for improved conversation coherence
- [ ] Add fine-tuning capabilities
